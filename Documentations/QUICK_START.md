## 💡 Top 3 Insights

### 1. **Child Enrolment Gold Mine** 
65% of all enrolments are ages 0-5! This is success—but it's also a base to build on. Adult outreach is the next frontier.

### 2. **September Surge** 
Enrolment peaks at 1.48M in September. You need 2.5x normal capacity that month. Plan accordingly.

### 3. **Five States Lagging** 
ODISHA, Tripura, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur are far behind. Deploy camps + awareness there.
